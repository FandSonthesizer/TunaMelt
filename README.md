# TunaMelt
Our Tuna Melt clone. 

This is out attempt tobuild a Tuna Melt clone. We changed it to have a true bypass, also we are using standart parts which are not hard to get by.
The Vactrol consists of an LDR03 light sensitive resistor and a white LED, bound together with some black electrical tape.

Sounds great, a very nice Tremolo indeed!
