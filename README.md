# TunaMelt
Our Tuna Melt clone. 

This is out attempt to build a Tuna Melt clone. We changed it to have a true bypass, also we are using standart parts which are not hard to get by.
The Vactrol consists of an LDR03 light sensitive resistor and a white 3mm LED, bound together head on head with some black electrical tape.

So we re-named it the FnS Melt. :-)

This effect just sounds great, a very nice Tremolo indeed!
